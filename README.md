# Relearning C++

This repo is just for me to complete the exercises provided by "C++ Programming for Games" by Frank Luna.

## Finding the book

[C++ Game Programming Module I](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Game%20Development/Programming/C%2B%2B%20Module%20I.pdf)
[C++ Game Programming Module II](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Game%20Development/Programming/C%2B%2B%20Module%20II.pdf)


## Environment Variables

`CC`: `path to gcc`
`CXX`: `path to g++`

## Notes

* `CMake` is a little strange, but it definitely will be useful.
* `VSCode` is goated.
